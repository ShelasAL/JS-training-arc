### TRAINING ON JAVASCRIPT TO MASTER THE LANGUAGE


This repo contains notes made by me in my javascript learning process.


I made sure that after reading this no one will have any confusion
as i have used in depth notes and specific reason why the code works differently in some places.
I hope that this will be helpful for people who are also trying to learn javascript.


### *IMPORTANT*

Install "colourful comments" extention for VScode while reading as i used different colours of comments to diffrent places for user friendly experience while reading..

### *SOME THINGS I WANNA SAY TO YOU*

*"Hey!! Dont't give up, continue your journey and master the language."*


**Tips:-**


=>take breaks.


=>Use AI tools like Bard or Copilot by Microsoft when you are stuck (As its free and can give you solution from images).


=>Take on a challenge to code atleast once a day and maintain consistancy.


=>Read through each and every single notes before starting the next topic.


=>Make self notes and experiment things yourself and think of solution and confirm it with use of AI tools I mentioned above.

=>Also understand that there will be times when you find yourself being overwhelmed by stuffs and thats totaly normal in the learning stage.

=>So just take breaks and then tackle it again till ya gets it.

**So Goodluck Guys ^^**
